## `dyn` keyword

The `dyn` keyword is used to highlight that calls to methods on the associated Trait are [dynamically dispatched](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_dispatch). To use the trait this way, it must be ‘dyn-compatible’ (Formerly known as ‘object safe’).

Unlike generic parameters or `impl` Trait, the compiler does not know the concrete type that is being passed. That is, the type has been erased. As such, a `dyn` Trait reference contains two pointers. One pointer goes to the data (e.g., an instance of a struct). Another pointer goes to a map of method call names to function pointers (known as a virtual method table or vtable).

At run-time, when a method needs to be called on the `dyn` Trait, the vtable is consulted to get the function pointer and then that function pointer is called.

See the Reference for more information on trait objects and object safety.

## Trade-offs

The above indirection is the additional runtime cost of calling a function on a `dyn` Trait. Methods called by dynamic dispatch generally cannot be inlined by the compiler.

However, `dyn` Trait is likely to produce smaller code than impl Trait / generic parameters as the method won’t be duplicated for each concrete type.
