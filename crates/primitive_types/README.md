# Primitive types

The Rust language has a number of built-in types that are considered
primitive. These types are the most basic types in the language and
are provided by the language itself rather than by libraries. They
represent single values rather than collections of values.

Rust is a statically typed language, which means that it must know the types of all variables at compile time.


Here are the primitive types in Rust:


- [Numeric types](docs/numerics.md)
- [Booleans](docs/booleans.md)
- [Characters](docs/characters.md)
